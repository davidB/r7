h1. Notes


h2. References

* Zinga games : FarmVille, CityVille etc...
* "Old" MMOs : WOW, DAOC, Ultima Online,
* F2P MMOs : Runes of Magic, Dark Orbit, Metin 2, Grepolis

h2. Terminology

* Free to play means no subscription, and only item selling (ex : The Settlers Online)

* Freemium means your game has 2 modes :
** free mode, with limited features
** subscription based premium mode, with all features unlocked
ex : Ogame, Dofus

* F2P is more profitable than freemium (no subscription cap), except for young audience (ex : clubpenguin)

h2. Designing F2P games

The game designer is responsible for the monetization of features.
Every feature put in the game has to be analyzed in terms of fun AND monetization.
Fair play is also a consideration, because when it's not fair it's not fun, but monetization is more important.

Easy way to test your game :
- play without paying
- play with 10€
- play with 500€

It has to be fun in all situations, but the more money you spend, the more you should enjoy the game.
You should allow players to spend as much money as possible even on their first day.
But be careful with payment options that can be canceled : a paypal payment may be canceled even 3 months later.

h2. Metrics

Metrics are the 3rd pillar of F2P game design.
They are used to improve the rentability of the game over time, and your game life time is generally high (13 years for UO).
It's easy to get lost in the amount of data that can be tracked, so you have to know what you are looking for.

h2. Internationalization

Allows you to reach an audience you wouldn't think of.
You have to lower your specs requirements if you want to reach the largest possible audience.
Provide as many payment options as possible : russians do not use credit cards for instance.

h2. Currencies

The hard currency must be tracked extremely close by.
You have to be able to refund a player, and you may have to pay taxes on it in the future.
Beware of hard currency transfers between players.

h2. Accessibilty

Reduce the loading time as much as possible, every second makes you lose users.
The first steps in the game should be awesome, they are the most important.
Tutorial should be disguised, but are necessary.
Don't show everything : let the player ask other players, in order to tie him socially.
Send a welcome email so the user knows how to get back to the game if he quits.

h2. Game requirements

* Player progression : everyone knows what XP means, use it
* A lot of content : that's why MMOs work so well
* A customizable avatar : every player wants to feel unique
* Economy : allow trading, crafting, create an auction house

h2. Asynchronous Game Design

The game designer should be aware of the technical constraints behind massively multiplayer games (or have programmers around)
This way, he can design features and systems compatible with them.
Ex : synchronous trade is impossible
Ex : the chat in the settlers online feels "real time", but is only updated every 10 seconds

Generally, this means putting cooldowns everywhere, but you can monetize them \!

h2. Social Design

Social design is marketing bullshit, no game on Facebook is social. WOW is 10000 times more social than FarmVille.
Social systems, however, are important, but more important are the connections between them, because it makes them meaningful.

h2. Out of Client

Elements outside the game that are extremely important :
* community management (use hardcore players as moderators)
* support (answers technical issues)
* analytics (to track data)
* e-marketing (= pay item design)
* split the dev team in two :
** one works on the expansions (long term developement)
** one works on short term improvements, strongly influenced by metrics
